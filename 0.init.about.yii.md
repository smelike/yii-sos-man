## What is Yii

Yii is a high performance, component-based PHP framework for rapidly developing modern Web applications.


## What is Yii Best for?

A generic Web programming framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds of Web applications using PHP.

Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching support, it is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications 

such as portals, forum, content management system (CMS), e-commerce projects, RESTful Web service, and so on.



## How does Yii Compare with Other Frameworks?

- Yii implements the MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern and promotes code organization based on that pattern.

- Yii takes the philosophy that code should be written in a simple yet elegant way. Yii will never try to over-design things mainly for the purpose of strictly following some design pattern.

- Yii is a full-stack framework providing many proven and ready-to-use features: query builders and ActiveRecord for both relational and NoSQL database; RESTful API development support; multi-tier caching support; and more.


- Yii is extremely extensible. You can customize or replace nearly every piece of the core's code. You can also take advantage of Yii's solid extension architecture to use or develop redistributable extensions.


- High performance is always a primary goal of Yii.
